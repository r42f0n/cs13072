(100 marks,   10%   of   the final grade)
1. (20 marks)   The following   are the training field   spectral statistics   for three   forest   types:Forest type mean spectral value standard deviation Black spruce 25 8 Paper birch 45 12 Quaking aspen 65 12 Show the likelihood   curves for these three cover types and   classify the following   image   using   the maximum   likelihood   rule.   In the classified   image   use   the following code: BS      for black spruce;   PB   for paper birch;   and   QA   for quaking aspen.   (5 marks for each line; 5 marks   for classification   results) Original   image 66 22 30 42 48 54

2. (20 marks,   5 for each) From the confusion matrix   shown below,
a. Calculate the producer’s accuracy   for Type 2;
b. Calculate the user’s   accuracy   for Type   1;
c. Calculate the overall   accuracy and   the KHAT value of   this classification (show   intermediate calculations);
d. Explain why KHAT   better represents the classification accuracy than the overall   accuracy.Classified Cover Type

3. (20   marks)    Image   classification.   Following   Lab   5   exercise,   produce   classified   images   using unsupervised   and   supervised   methods with   the following classes: vegetation, water   and   built   area (bare soil).   Attach final land   cover maps   in color   in screenshots.   (10 marks   for each)
4. (20 marks)    Explain   the main   difference and   similarity between supervised   and unsupervised   classification.   (5 marks) Provide an error matrix for the supervised classification   of   the image in   Lab 5. (10 marks) Discuss the accuracy   assessment   on   the supervised   classification.   (5 marks)
